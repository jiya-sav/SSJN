            "content": "SSJN Group Project . How it will Work . Users enter their current emotion into a text entry box | User is then prompted to fill out an optional survey to further personalize song list. | The program outputs a list of songs that match their current emotion, with spotify links embedded, so the users can explore new music! | Spotify x SSJN! . . xxx . . Roles . Scrum Master: Shreya Sapkal | Frontend Developer: Noor Grewal | Backend Developers: Sanika Shahapurkar &amp; Jiya Savlani | . Implementation: 6 Principles of College Board . Program Purpose and Function | To help users discover new types of music, artists, and songs. To help users diversify their music listening experience. To match users with a list of songs to listen to depending on their current emotion. Input: Emotion/Mood (out of options provided) Output: Song that matches mood (selected out of info provided from API, additional information like lyrics or link to listen may be provided) . Data Abstraction | Output will be displayed using a list, to provide multiple song options to diversify users listening experience. Planned name of varibale representing list: Melancholy = [“I Bet On Losing Dogs”, “See You Again”, “Burning Hill”] Data in this list represents music type . Managing Complexity | By using lists to display song output, it is not necessary to write continuous lines of if/else statements, though they may still be useful for further personalization. In case that list is not used to provide songs, multiple functions may have to be written and printed seperately ex: if Emotion=Melancholy print(“I Bet On Losing Dogs”” print(“See You Again”) print(“Burning Hill”) . Procedural Abstraction | Use procedural abstraction to account for user error input, to ensure selected Emotion is existent in program ex: def emotion_input if Emotion = melancholy print(“Melancholy”) elif Emotion = joy print(“Joy”) else print(“Please input emotion”) . Algorithm Implementation sequencing Use of strings and lists to output song information, as well as error information (shown above) | selection Use of if/else/elif statements (as shown above) | iteration Use of for loops (*still planning how this may be implemented productively into program given function) ex: emotion = [“melancholy”, “joy”, “rage”] for x in emotion: if x == “joy”: break print(x) | . | Testing | Test each cell, which will be organized by purpose. Each line will have notes to ensure we manage complexity, as well as best enabling ourselves to explain in video. .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
